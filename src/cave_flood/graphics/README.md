Many images have two versions:
a low resolution to actually use in the game (for performance)
a full resolution version as a backup (in case increasing the resolution of the images is ever necessary)

The currently_using folder has images that are directly used in the game.
The full_resolution folder has the full resolution versions of images used in the game.
The not_currently_using folder has outdated images
